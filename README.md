# Object-Oriented-Programming-LAB
This repository contains all the assignments completed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) Lab. The assignments cover various OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, file handling, and more.

# **Assignment 1 - OOPS Lab (Class & Objects)**  
this contain two files [question_1.cpp](https://github.com/himanshuranjandixit/Object-Oriented-Programming-LAB/blob/main/question_1.cpp) and other is [question_2.cpp](https://github.com/himanshuranjandixit/Object-Oriented-Programming-LAB/blob/main/question_2.cpp) 

# **ðŸ“‚ Contents:**  

1. **Problem 1**: Implement function overloading for an `average(int, int)` function that returns:  
   - `int` when called in one file.  
   - `double` when called in another file of the same program.  
   - Test with and without using directives.  

2. **Problem 2**: Implement a **Bank Account** class with:  
   - **Data Members:** Name, Account Number, Account Type, Balance.  
   - **Member Functions:** Initialize, Deposit, Withdraw (with balance check), Display details.  
   - Modify the program to handle **10 customers**.

# **ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:**  
âœ… Classes & Objects  
âœ… Function Overloading  
âœ… Data Members & Member Functions  
âœ… Encapsulation  
âœ… Constructor & Destructor

# **Assignment 2 - OOPS Lab (Constructor - Destructor)**  
this contain one files [question_3.cpp](https://github.com/himanshuranjandixit/Object-Oriented-Programming-LAB/blob/main/assignment_3.cpp)
   
1. **Problem 3**:

     Create a class named Time that contains integer fields  for hours and minutes. Store the hours in military time, that is, 0 through 23. Add a function that displays the fields, using a colon to separate hours and minutes. (Make sure the minutes display as two digits. For example, 3 oclock should display as 3:00, not 3:0.) Add another function that takes an argument that represents minutes to add to the time. The function updates the time based on the number of minutes added. For example, 12:30 plus 15 is 12:45, 14:50 plus 20 is 15:10, and 23:59 plus 2 is 0:01. The Time constructor requires an argument for hours. The argument for minutes is optional; the value defaults to 0 if no argument is supplied. The constructor ensures that the hours field is not greater than 23 and that the minutes field is not greater than 59; default to these maximum values if the arguments to the contructor are out of range. Create a main() function that instantiates an array of at least four Time objects and demonstrates that they display correctly both before and after varying amounts of time have been added to them.Use destructor in your class defination.
