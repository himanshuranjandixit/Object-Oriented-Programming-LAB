# Object-Oriented-Programming-LAB
This repository contains all the assignments completed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) Lab. The assignments cover various OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, file handling, and more.

# **Assignment 1 - OOPS Lab (Class & Objects)**  
this contain two files [question_1.cpp](https://github.com/himanshuranjandixit/Object-Oriented-Programming-LAB/blob/main/question_1.cpp) and other is [question_2.cpp] (https://github.com/himanshuranjandixit/Object-Oriented-Programming-LAB/blob/main/question_2.cpp) 

# **ðŸ“‚ Contents:**  

1. **Problem 1**: Implement function overloading for an `average(int, int)` function that returns:  
   - `int` when called in one file.  
   - `double` when called in another file of the same program.  
   - Test with and without using directives.  

2. **Problem 2**: Implement a **Bank Account** class with:  
   - **Data Members:** Name, Account Number, Account Type, Balance.  
   - **Member Functions:** Initialize, Deposit, Withdraw (with balance check), Display details.  
   - Modify the program to handle **10 customers**.
